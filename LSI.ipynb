In 1960 it was the fourth biggest inland sea in the world. Two rivers flowed into the sea, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. Muynak (population 12 000) was a busy fishing port on the shore of the Aral Sea. The surrounding desert was developed for growing cotton, a non-food crop. The waters of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were diverted and used for irrigation. This created an environmental and human disaster. Water evaporated and brought salt in the soil to the surface making it infertile. Salt now covers the old sea bed. begun to bring food such as rice, flour and oil to the poorest people. Cancers, lung disease and infant mortality are 30 times higher than they used to be in this region. The immune systems of local people have become weak due to poor nutrition and people are vulnerable to lung diseases such as tuberculosis. Big families live in very poor conditions and tuberculosis spreads very quickly. The Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan governments are trying to find solutions to the problem.
