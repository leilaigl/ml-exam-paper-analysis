On 21 November, an ash cloud from the summit reached 3842 metres above sea level and later grew to 9144 metres. Early on Saturday 25 November, some airlines cancelled flights bound for Australia and New Zealand. An orange glow was later observed around the crater at night, suggesting that fresh magma was moving to the surface.

Wheat farming in Kazakhstan in north-central Kazakhstan where there are fertile soils and the land is flat. Individual fields frequently measure over 400 hectares. Precipitation is low, about 450 mm per year, and wheat fields in this region are not irrigated. The region is subject to frequent drought. The use of fertilizer increased by nearly 500% between 1999 and 2007 and continues to increase due in part to the government subsidising prices. A technological factor contributing The government provides support to agricultural research facilities. replacement of ageing combined harvesters with new equipment. 77% of the total grain output is produced on farms that are larger than 5000 hectares. Family farms are substantially smaller than this. Family farms and the larger farms produce mainly for sale rather than for private consumption.

In 1960 it was the fourth biggest inland sea in the world. Two rivers flowed into the sea, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. Muynak (population 12 000) was a busy fishing port on the shore of the Aral Sea. The surrounding desert was developed for growing cotton, a non-food crop. The waters of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were diverted and used for irrigation. This created an environmental and human disaster. Water evaporated and brought salt in the soil to the surface making it infertile. Salt now covers the old sea bed. begun to bring food such as rice, flour and oil to the poorest people. Cancers, lung disease and infant mortality are 30 times higher than they used to be in this region. The immune systems of local people have become weak due to poor nutrition and people are vulnerable to lung diseases such as tuberculosis.
